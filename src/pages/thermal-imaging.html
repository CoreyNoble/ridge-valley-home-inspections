            <h3>Insufficient Or Improperly Installed Insulation</h3>
            <p>Thermal imaging can detect hot/cold spots in the wall where insulation has slouched over time, was incorrectly installed, or where insulation was never installed to begin with. This information is critical when trying to reduce your heating costs in winter and cooling costs in summer.</p>
            <p>A thermal imaging audit of a new home will leave the purchaser at ease that all of the insulation was properly installed when their home was built. Once the drywall is in place, it is not possible to see whether or not the insulation is in place. Knowing that the insulation is properly installed is of great value to a home owner, not only as an energy savings tool, but also to ensure that you are getting what you are paying for.</p>
            <h3>Moisture Intrusion/Mold Growth</h3>
            <p>Detecting where moisture has entered your home will allow for quick repairs in order to stop mold from growing and causing health hazards. Thermal imaging can detect moist areas, allowing the home owner to repair certain areas instead of removing all materials and doing a major overhaul. This will reduce the cost of the repair significantly. - Moisture can be detected by thermal imaging that cannot be seen by the naked eye. This is a great additional benefit when performing a home inspection. Moisture spots will be determined beforehand, so that you can make an informed decision before purchasing a new home. - Removing moisture also stops your structural materials from rotting, which will maintain your home's structural integrity, keeping your home safe for those who live in it.

            <h3>Radiant In Floor Heating</h3>
            <p>Determining where a leak is located in an in floor heating system can be very difficult. Using thermal imaging, water leaks are easily detected. This allows for precise repair work, resulting in less damage to existing structures and less overall cost.</p>
            <p>A thermal snapshot of the heated area can also help troubleshoot faulty legs in your heating system. Repairing these faults will allow for a more even heat being applied to the area, increasing your comfort level.</p>
            <h3>Insect Or Pest Intrusion</h3>
            <p>Insulation is typically used for building nests when mice find their way into your walls. When they remove the insulation for their nest, a hot/cold spot will appear where the insulation was taken from. Thermal imaging can be used to determine if these spots exist. Even if you don't see any signs of mice, they can still be living in your walls.</p>
            <h3>Loose Or Damaged Electrical Components</h3>
            <p>Loose, damaged, or dirty connections can result in heating. As the connection degrades over time, the circuit breaker can start to trip under little apparent load, circuit breakers can fail, or worst of all, a fire can occur. Utilizing thermal imaging to inspect the various electrical connections in your home will allow you to detect these problems and remedy the fault before any damage has occurred.</p>
