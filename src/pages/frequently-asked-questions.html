                <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
                    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>Why do I need a home&nbsp;inspection?</h3></a>
                    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                        <p> Buying a home could be the largest single investment you will ever make. To minimize unpleasant surprises and unexpected difficulties, you’ll want to learn as much as you can about the newly constructed or existing house before you buy it. A home inspection may identify the need for major repairs or builder oversights, as well as the need for maintenance to keep it in good shape. After the inspection, you will know more about the house, which will allow you to make decisions with&nbsp;confidence.</p>
                        <p>If you already are a homeowner, a home inspection can identify problems in the making and suggest preventive measures that might help you avoid costly future&nbsp;repairs.</p>
                        <p>If you are planning to sell your home, a home inspection can give you the opportunity to make repairs that will put the house in better selling&nbsp;condition.</p> 
                    </div>
                </li>

                <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
                    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>What will it&nbsp;cost?</h3></a>
                    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                        <p>The inspection fee for a typical one-family house varies geographically, as does the cost of housing. Similarly, within a given area, the inspection fee may vary depending on a number of factors such as the size of the house, its age and possible optional&nbsp;services.</p>   
                        <p>Do not let cost be a factor in deciding whether or not to have a home inspection or in the selection of your home inspector. The sense of security and knowledge gained from an inspection is well worth the cost, and the lowest-priced inspection is not necessarily a bargain. Use the inspector’s qualifications, including experience, training, compliance with your provinces regulations, if any, and professional affiliations as a&nbsp;guide.</p>

                </li>

                <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
                    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>Why can't I do it&nbsp;myself?</h3></a> 
                    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>   
                        <p>Even the most experienced homeowner lacks the knowledge and expertise of a professional home inspector. An inspector is familiar with the elements of home construction, proper installation, maintenance and home safety. He or she knows how the home’s systems and components are intended to function together, as well as why they&nbsp;fail.</p>
                        <p>Above all, most buyers find it difficult to remain completely objective and unemotional about the house they really want, and this may have an effect on their judgment. For accurate information, it is best to obtain an impartial, third-party opinion by a professional in the field of home&nbsp;inspection.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>

                <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
                    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>Can a house fail a home&nbsp;inspection?</h3></a>
                    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                        <p>No. A professional home inspection is an examination of the current condition of a house. It is not an appraisal, which determines market value. It is not a municipal inspection, which verifies local code compliance. A home inspector, therefore, will not pass or fail a house, but rather describe its physical condition and indicate what components and systems may need major repair or&nbsp;replacement.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>

                <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
                    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>Do I have to be&nbsp;there?</h3></a>
                    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                        <p>While it’s not required that you be present for the inspection, it is highly recommended. You will be able to observe the inspection and ask questions as you learn about the condition of the home and how to maintain&nbsp;it.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>

                <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
                    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>What if the report reveals&nbsp;problems?</h3></a>
                    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                        <p>No house is perfect. If the inspector identifies problems, it doesn’t mean you should or shouldn’t buy the house, only that you will know in advance what to expect. If your budget is tight, or if you don’t want to become involved in future repair work, this information will be important to you. If major problems are found, a seller may agree to make&nbsp;repairs.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>

                <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
                    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>If the house proves to be in good condition, did I really need an&nbsp;inspection?</h3></a>
                    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                        <p>Definitely. Now you can complete your home purchase with confidence. You’ll have learned many things about your new home from the inspector’s written report, and will have that information for future&nbsp;reference.</p>

                    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>What is Infrared Thermal&nbsp;Imaging?</h3></a>
                    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                        <p>Infrared Thermal Imaging is a visual display of the amount of heat radiated from the different surfaces (or in other words the amount of infrared energy emitted), reflected or transmitted by objects. The thermal imaging camera is the most popular equipment for visual analysis and distinguishes between the electromagnetic energy radiated from objects within the infrared spectrum. The infrared spectrum is invisible to the human eye; however, the thermal imaging camera shifts this spectrum to a range that is visible to humans. This allows us to see and measure the temperature of the different&nbsp;surfaces.</p>
                        <p>Using thermal imaging technology in buildings and equipment allows us accurately to assess and locate insulation problems in the building. There are problems such as lack of insulation in the building envelope, water penetration sources, water leakage sources, electrical equipment, air leakage, or much&nbsp;more.</p>
                        <p>The building thermography process gives us the ability to identify the energy loss locations and their sources. Such sources can be missing or defective insulation, moisture penetration, air leaks, and thermal bridging. The data collected by the thermal imaging camera is not only the image itself, but other parameters that help the inspector analyze the information obtained for more accurate results. The Infrared Thermal Imaging Report provides you with comprehensive information about your building, detailed information about the potential problems, and suggestions for remedies. The report is prepared by a Certified Level 1&nbsp;Thermographer.</p>
