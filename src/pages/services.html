          <h3>Benefits of a Home&nbsp;Inspection:</h3>
          <p>A home is likely one of the largest investments you will ever make. Wouldn't it be nice to have the piece of mind your making an informed decision prior to committing to this purchase for the next several&nbsp;years.</p>
          <p>We often know an expert whether it's a electrician, a plumber or our Dad. These people may have vast knowledge in one or several areas of your home and we encourage you to let them have a look. However a home inspector can add that confidence of an expert opinion on all aspects of the&nbsp;home.</p>
          <p>Home inspections are becoming part of the process in selling the majority of homes today. Not only is it common to have a home inspected prior to committing to purchase but many are hiring a professional home&nbsp;inspector.</p>
          <ul>
	        <li>before they put their home on the&nbsp;market</li>
	        <li>follow up inspections</li>
	        <li>Pre-delivery inspection of new&nbsp;homes</li>
	        <li>and warranty expiration&nbsp;inspections</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These are just a few services we&nbsp;offer.</p>
