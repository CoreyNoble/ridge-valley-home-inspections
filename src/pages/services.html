            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pre delivery inspections (P.D.I.):</strong> This is an inspection performed prior to the owner signing off on a new home. Once the owner signs off on the home it’s their responsibility and not the builders. This service can be useful if the owner of the home being built has some concerns prior to signing off responsibility from the&nbsp;builder.</li>
                <li><strong>New home warranty inspections:</strong> TARION is an agency which all new home construction companies must be a member of. This is who offers your new home warranty. It is the owner’s responsibility to bring any concerns to TARION prior to the expiration dates, to ensure any issues are&nbsp;resolved.</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-Purchase inspections (Buyers):</strong> A buyer inspections by far the most common service. Studies suggest over 90% of homes sold today are inspected by a professional home inspector. These are most often initiated by the buyer. Most offers are conditional offers based on financing and the results of a home&nbsp;inspection.</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-Sale inspections (Sellers):</strong> These are becoming more popular. This is when the seller hires the home inspector to inspect the property prior to, or while a home is for sale. The advantage is, this will give the seller an opportunity to address any concerns with the home before an offer is made, this can speed up negotiations and the closing process. Also if a seller has had the home inspected prior to selling they may choose to leave the inspection report displayed for potential buyers to have a look at. This can save time because the buyer may not have the need to hire another inspector and the deal may go through&nbsp;faster.</li>
                <li><strong>Follow up inspections:</strong> A follow up inspection is offered for those who’ve already had Ridge Valley Home Inspections inspect their home. This service is recommended eight to twelve months after the initial inspection, or after some major work has been completed on the same home. The intent is to follow up utilizing the original report and focusing on the weaker areas stressed on the&nbsp;inspection.</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-Sale/Pre-Purchase Combo:</strong> Designed for customers who want to make their current home more marketable and save on the inspection of their future home. This package will ensure you receive the best value for your inspection&nbsp;budget.</li>
                <li><strong>Thermo Imaging/Infrared:</strong> This service will assist in determining hidden deficiencies that may not been seen with the naked eye. Your Thermo Imaging Inspection can assist in determining issues with: Insufficient or Improperly Installed Insulation, Moisture Intrusion/Mold Growth, Loose or Damaged Electrical Components, In Floor Heating Systems and possible Insect or Pest&nbsp;Intrusion.</li>
